// //  Simple Timer Solution

// // Step 1:
// // Use the following Audio file below:
// var audio = new Audio("raven.mp3");

// //  Step 2:
// //  after 5 seconds, execute the fiveSeconds function
// //  after 10 seconds, execute the tenSeconds function
// //  after 15 seconds, execute the timeUp function

// setTimeout(fiveSeconds, 1000 * 5);
// setTimeout(tenSeconds, 1000 * 10);
// setTimeout(timeUp, 1000 * 15);

// //  Step 3:
// //  Fill in the blanks to these functions.
// function fiveSeconds() {
//   // in the element with an id of time-left add an h2 saying About 10 Seconds Left!
//   // console log 10 seconds left
//   $("#time-left").append("<h2>About 10 Seconds Left!</h2>");
//   console.log("10 seconds left");
// }

// function tenSeconds() {
//   // in the element with an id of time-left add an h2 saying About 5 Seconds Left!
//   // console log 5 seconds left
//   $("#time-left").append("<h2>About 5 Seconds Left!</h2>");
//   console.log("5 seconds left");
// }

// function timeUp() {
//   // in the element with an id of time-left add an h2 saying Time's Up!
//   // console log done
//   console.log("done");
//   $("#time-left").append("<h2>Time's Up!</h2>");
//   console.log("time is up");

//   //  The following line will play the audio file we linked to above:
//   audio.play();
// }
